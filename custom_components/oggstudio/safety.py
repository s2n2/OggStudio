"""Safety: stop everything, per-device limits, and stopping when a browser goes away.

* ``oggstudio.panic`` (also the Stop everything button, and the
  ``OGGSTUDIO_PANIC`` notification action) stops every Ogg device, drops all
  control claims and tells every open card to halt what it is doing.
* Limits are kept per device and shown to the cards, which apply them to
  everything they send. ``oggstudio.play`` applies the intensity limit too.
* A card holds an ``oggstudio/session`` subscription open while it is on
  screen. When its connection goes (page closed, phone asleep, network lost),
  the devices it was driving are stopped at once.
